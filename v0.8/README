 $ ABOUT
 ========
 What is this project about?

 This project also called "update-fstab" is a Python script that makes use of a local config, in
 which different variables are set up. You can modify those at your pleasure to tell `update-fstab'
 which files to modify, where to create the backup and logs and under what name.

 Main function of this Python script is to update the `fstab' file in a Linux-based system, while
 it provides a "common template" that specifies automatically the last 3 parameters for you.

 It also makes use of checksum to make you pay attention when it was last modified both the fstab
 file and the config.

 This all started at the time I was learning about LVM (Logical Volume Management) and it was needed
 to update the fstab file in order to mount several logical volumes making use of mapper driver that
 was built-in (compiled in) the kernel. Since there was no tool for this, I decided to create my own
 and learn more about checksums and how these work.

 update-fstab project is open and opensource for everybody letting them modify,create and export it.
 update-fstab project is registered under the GNU/GPL (GNU General Public License), see LICENSE for
 more details.

 Note that it may also come with various codenames (see below the changelog).

 ============
 $ CHANGELOG
 ============

 ==================================
 v0.8 [26.Jun] - codename "Demeter"
 ==================================
 Well, the only significant update worth mentioning (in my opinion) in this version is that,
 update-fstab has been ported to git. Overbloated folders full of different versions are now in the
 old days and already forgotten.

 Also some better parsing of help switches has been implemented and the config was updated to now
 log and backup in current (local) folders "log/" and respectively "backup/".

 Enjoy.




 =================================
 v0.7 [20.Jun] - codename "Alipso"
 =================================
 Now `2date.py' is available, this updates your files accordingly,
 so you won't be needing to do it manually like:

 ./checksum.py <fstab file> then
 after the changes -> put the checksum in the config to `cache' parameter
 
 ./checksum.py <config file> then 
 after the changes -> specify the value in the script to variable `confcache'

 you can now just `./2date.py' if you are using defaults:
     - 0xffffffff        - the checksum nod
     - /etc/fstab        - the fstab file (I was told on UNIX it might be: /etc/vfstab)
     - update-fstab.py   - the script
     - update-fstab.conf   - the config file

 or use `./2date.py -h' to get more info on how to specify new values instead of defaults
 
 
 Hope this helps somehow.


========================================================================================
 NOTE: ZFS (Zetta-byte filesystem) uses different mounting scheme, this is advised to
       use with other filesystems or volume managers. This script was intended for
       LVM (Logical Volume Manager) version 2 that uses device mapper in the mounting
       scheme. Be advised! As a System Administrator you should know what is best for
       your system, so be careful and think a lot before you act.
